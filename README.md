### bamazonAPP

# Welcome to the bamazon shopping experience!

## Overview (Minimum Requirement)

Once the bamazonAPP is started with *node bamazonCustomer.js* in the command line, you will embark on a shopping experience. A full list of available products will be shown. Following the prompts through the shopping experience you can purchase an item or 10 and the bamazon user guide will be with you every step of the way.

## Details

Below are some pertinent details regarding the bamazonAPP and UI.

* Not visible throught the UI in the command line is the database. The mySQL database houses the tables that hold the data that bamazon runs on. Each item has:
    * A unique Item Id
    * A Product name
    * Department name
    * Price
    * Stock Quantity
* Throughout the shopping experience we utilized timeouts to deliver messages to essentially slow down the experience to make it feel more natural as the command line works very quickly. These timeouts also give the appearance of **things** going on in the background.
